# Text-Editor 

This project is my attempt to build a basic Python text editor containing various features to assist the users with their goals. Many more features and improvements will be added in the future since the project is still in being worked on. I have built this using Tkinter as well as with the use if a library called SpeechRecognition which is the foundation of the speech-to-text feature in this project.
